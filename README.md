# Trolley-Tracker-Exercise
MIT xPro Bus Tracking Exercise - 9

You have arrived at the Willow River Trolley exercise!  This animation shows you stop by stop the Willow River Trolley route in scenic Willow River State Park, St. Croix County WI. The marker updates to the next stop automatically and progresses to the end. It is triggered off of GPS coordinates that are available through the St. Croix County Park Transportation site.

<u>HOW TO RUN</u>
As soon as you click the upper left button, the map marker will start to animate!  You can watch as it shows you the stops.

<u>FUTURE ROADMAP</>

My plans are to flush out this excercise with more stops, the Trolley has many.  Adding a descriptive name or feature of the park at the stops would be a great feature as well (once I learn how to do that!).
